 * Note how each of these actors is passed a web-socket Actor.
 *
 * The web-socket Actor is created by Play and handles the web-socket
 * communication itself. The Actor implemented by this class deals
 * with what to DO with the communication going on in the web-socket.
 *
 * The web-socket Actor will forward plain/raw String messages to
 * this Actor, and when we want to send plain/raw Strings back,
 * we will send them to the web-socket Actor, which will forward
 * these to the browser.
 *
 * Internally, however, we want to convert to Scala-objects (case-classes)
 * and deal with these as soon and as much as possible.
